# Innovation-Management
Course of Innovation Management of master degree in Data Science & Engineering.
The project is built by three different views of an important application in the mobile payments sector: the in-vehicle payments.
This type of research consists of three different views of the same technology, following a strategic and innovative perspective.

## Dynamics of innovation
The first part deals with the principal concepts of innovation. For instance, there is a discussion about the influence of embedded in-vehicle payments technology in the market and in the society, underlying also the differences with the current paradigm of integrated in-vehicle payments. Then, there is the listing of different knowledge types required (i.e. factual, positional, procedural and causal knowledge). After, there is a more specific definition of the determinants of innovation and the plot of s-curves trajectories, in view to underline the evolution of in-vehicle payment sector. Finally, this subsection describes also the dynamics of innovation, by exploiting the Abernathy-Utterback model, which is the most popular framework used. 
## Technology readiness
This subsection analyzes the number of patents filled by companies involved in the embedded in-vehicle payments. This kind of study results to be quite important to catch the main disciplines involved to build such technology. After this high level research, hot topics and holes still present inside in-vehicle payment proposal are underlined, as well as the geographical location of technology's evolution.
## Strategic management
The final point of the case study is to try building a business model canvas. The aim is to imagine to put in place of entrepreneurs who are willing to introduce their own product (based on in-vehicle payment technology) in the market. After a brief Porter's forces analyzes, all the elements of business model canvas are analyzed. Starting from the customers, passing through the value proposition and revenue model, until the value chain aspects. Then, there is emphasis on the role of data and how they can bring competitive advantage in this kind of market.
